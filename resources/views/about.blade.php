    <p class="indent-2">
        I completed the Laracasts course <em>"30 Days to Learn Laravel"</em> and wanted to build something using Laravel.
        Yeah, I also bought a Laracasts lifetime subscription as it was on sale (60% off). My portfolio is getting
        a bit outdated as I built the project before learning how to set up a CI/CD pipeline. This project is hosted on my home server
        with the help of Cloudflare.

        There are many skills I want to improve, such as programming, guitar, bass, keyboard, gardening, Japanese chess and so on.
        I believe sharing your skills publicly is important, and nowadays, many people use videos to do that.
        I already have some programming project videos on YouTube, so I thought it would be nice to display them in a way that I envisioned.
        Hopefully, this project will motivate me to start uploading videos of myself playing instruments â€” especially the bass.
